# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

This is a learning project for exploring Claude Code features and capabilities. The repository will grow as new experiments and examples are added.

## Notes

- This is an exploratory/learning environment — prefer clear, readable code over optimized or production-hardened solutions.
- When adding new examples or experiments, organize them in descriptively named files or subdirectories so the purpose is self-evident.
